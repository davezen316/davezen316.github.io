<center><p class="drawContent1">I started drawing since I'm was a small kid. At the begining, I just drawing for fun, I drew a lot of things without thinking. The moment that I realised the purpose of my drawing is because of my brother. A long time ago, I looked at my brother's artwork, and he was explaining the personality and the story of the characters that he created, it was very attractive to me. From that time, I started created a lot of stories and drawing characters for my stories. It becomes the motion for me to draw gradually. Thanks to this wonderful opportunity, it lets me found the thing I like and my speciality.</p></center>

When characters are standing in different position, according to their personality, they will taking what kind of action to face their challenges? I always enjoying in this part of creation. Most of my characters are waiting to be rescue by others, because of all characters that I created are containing my personality and thinking, when I redeem them in my stories, I feel that I am be rescuing too.</td>
